I’m a developer who likes **clean interfaces**, **small tools**, and **systems that age well**.

### What I’m into
- Building web apps and automation that remove friction
- Writing about debugging, architecture choices, and product tradeoffs
- Learning by shipping (even tiny experiments)

### How I work
- Start with the problem + smallest viable slice
- Prefer boring tech until it hurts
- Make feedback loops fast (tests, logs, prototypes)
