Here are a few things I’ve built (or I’m building). Each one has notes on design decisions and what I learned.

## Project Template (starter)
**Name:**  
**What it does:**  
**Stack:**  
**Links:** repo | demo  
**Notes:** why I built it + tradeoffs + what’s next

## Ideas to start with
- A tiny dashboard (weather, bookmarks, quick notes)
- A Markdown-to-HTML notes viewer
- A “learning log” site section that auto-lists posts by topic
- A small API-powered app (e.g., GitHub profile viewer)
